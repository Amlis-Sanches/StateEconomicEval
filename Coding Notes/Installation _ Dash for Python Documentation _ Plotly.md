In your terminal, install `dash`.

```shell
pip install dash
```

This also brings along the `plotly` graphing library. This library is under active development, so install and upgrade frequently.

We also recommend installing [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), which is required by [Plotly Express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/) and used in many of our examples.

```shell
pip install pandas
```

With Dash installed, you can run the examples in the documentation in an `app.py` file with `python app.py`, or in a Jupyter Notebook.

These docs are running `dash` version `2.18.0`.
